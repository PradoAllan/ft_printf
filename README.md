# ft_printf
Hi! Hope you are doing great!
This is my Printf project from my common core journey, as a cadet, at 42 RIO.

The main proposal of this project is to develop a replica of the original "printf()" function in C. So, you can use it to output every thing you want, just like the printf function.
But, as I said, it's just a replica, so you can only print using this formats bellow:
- "%c" -> Used to print a char.
- "%s" -> Used to print a string (C string).
- "%i" -> Used to print a int.
- "%d" -> Used to print a int.
- "%x" -> Used to print a int number in hexadecimal.(lower case).
- "%X" -> Used to print a int number in hexadecimal. (upper case).
- "%p" -> Used to print a pointer.
- "%u" -> Used to print a unsigned int.
- "%%" -> Used to print the '%'.

To develop the function I needes to study about "Variadic functions" and it's functionalities, for exemple: va_list, va_start, va_arg and va_end.

Every line of code was made in C.
